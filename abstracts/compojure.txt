# Intro to Web Development with Compojure

Compojure is a web framework, inspired by Sinatra and implemented in Clojure. In this session, you will learn:

* Why functional languages are a good fit for web development. (It's simple, really: a web endpoint is a function of URLs, headers, bodies, and sessions. Everything else is noise and distraction.)
* How function composition simplifies adding services. Compojure middlewares are simply functions that can wrap existing functions to add additional services.
* The usual suspects: APIs for dealing with headers, bodies, sessions, cookies, etc.
* How Compojure is embedded in traditional Java servlet environments: "It's just a jar!"
* A variety of approaches to rendering views: JSP-like templating, using Clojure data structures as a natural DSL, and using the functional Enlive library.
* Integrating with data stores, both relational and NoSQL.

The examples will include hands-on exercises that you can take home.
