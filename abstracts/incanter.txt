# Data Analysis with Incanter

Incanter is a Clojure-based, R-like platform for statistical computing and graphics. In this session you will learn:

* The basics of manipulating data via Incanter datasets
* Charting your data: how Incanter makes JFreeChart easier than ever before
* A quick tour of the many libraries provided (or wrapped) by Incanter.

Incanter can bring quants and devs together like never before, by providing the power of quant tools in a production-ready language and VM environment (Clojure on the JVM).

Examples will include hands-on exercises for you to take home.
