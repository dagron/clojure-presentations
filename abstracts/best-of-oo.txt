# The Best of OO: Clojure Types and Protocols

The best abstraction in OO is the interface: a pure specification that can
the be implemented polymorphically by many different
callees. Clojure's types and protocols generalize this idea to solve
the expression problem. In this session you will learn:

* What the expression problem is.
* How the expression problem hurts your code every day, through wrappers, mixins, adapters, facades, open classes, and monkey patches.
* How protocols solve the expression problem.
* Ease of use matters: using protocols and types are as simple as classes and interfaces.
* Performance matters too: protocols take advantage of the host environment's support for fast polymorphic dispatch.  

Examples will include hands-on exercises for you to take home.
